go-pod
===========

go-pod is a small practice project. Its purpose is to build an application project using Package Oriented Design as 
William Kennedy's describes it in its blog article (to see more details about this design pattern check the post [https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/02/package-oriented-design.html])
I tried to use as few dependencies as possible while keeping the code simple.
